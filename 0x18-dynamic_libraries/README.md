## Task

### Task 0. A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life: Create the dynamic library libholberton.so

### Task 1. Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future mandatory: Create a script that creates a dynamic library called liball.so from all the .c files that are in the current directory.
