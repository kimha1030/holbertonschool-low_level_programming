# **Low-Level Programming**

Low-level programming involves languages ​​that provide little or no abstraction from machine language.

In the low level Programming track is possible to learn how programming languages ​​and Unix systems work, this will allow you to optimize and debug any developed program.

Algorithms and data structures are used in all Foundations trimesters.

## Topics

### First Trimester

- Basics
- Functions
- Pointers
- Data Structures: Arrays, Singly Linked Lists
- Bit Manipulation
- Variadic Functions
- Memory Management
- File Redirection
- printf
- Shell
- Compilation
- Heap/Stack
- Static Libraries

### Second Trimester

- Data Structures: Stacks/Queues, Doubly Linked Lists, Hash Tables, Binary Trees
- Algorithms: Sorting Algorithms, Big O Notation, Dynamic Libraries

### Third Trimester

- Algorithms: Search Algorithms
